## Description

This project is a simplified version of the C standard library `printf` function.  
It prints formatted output to the standard output and supports basic format specifiers.

### Handled format specifiers:
- %c : character  
- %s : string  
- %% : percent sign  
- %d / %i : signed decimal integer

### Limitations:
- Does not handle flags, field width, precision, or length modifiers.  
- Buffer handling is simplified.

Includes a custom man page (`man_3_printf`).
